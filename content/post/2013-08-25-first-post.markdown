I tried blogging using wordpress and blogger, but I didn't like the amount of control it offered. 
[Octopress][octopress] was awesome, but I wanted to have something I could build and 
customize from the ground up. 
So I went back to the source and started with just [jekyll][Jekyll]. A
fter fiddling with the default css, I'm going to use Bootstrap to take care of
all the heavy lifting. 
All this responsive web stuff is pretty new to me, so I'll get my feet wet this way. 
Not to mention playing around with [LESS][less] (which is really awesome!).

So lets see where this goes. 

[jekyll]:    http://jekyllrb.com
[octopress]: http://octopress.org/
[less]:     http://lesscss.org/
