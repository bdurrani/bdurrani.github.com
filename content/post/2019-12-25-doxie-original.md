This is more of a reminder for me than anything else. 
I've had my doxie original for a number of years now. With Windows 10, they stopped
supporting the driver.

After some investigation, turns out an original Doxie is actually a [DocketPORT467](http://www.docucap.com/docketport-467/).

If you still want to keep using your original Doxie, but you're ok with going without the
other Doxie software, just grab the drivers from the [docucap website](http://www.docketport.com/DocketPORT-Support/Drivers-Downloads)

I'll also upload the drivers for Windows 10 [here](/assets/doxie-original/DocketPORT467_v1.3.6_64bit_setup.exe).
This is current as of Dec 2019.

I can confirm I can use the built-in Scanning software with my original Doxie now.
No need to buy another scanner. This one still works great!
